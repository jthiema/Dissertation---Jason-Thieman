A variation of $\pm 4.6\%$ on the minimum bias cross section is used to estimate the uncertainties due to pileup modeling.
To estimate the impact from pile-up on the signal selection efficiency, the simulated pile-up distribution is varied according to a $\pm 4.6\%$ variation of the minimum bias cross section (cf. Sect.~\ref{sec:evtSel}) with respect to the nominal value. 
Distributions are created using the following variations of the minimum bias cross section with the pile-up calculator: --minBiasXsec ==  66017 ($-4.6\%$), 69200 (Nominal), 72383 ($+4.6\%$).


To account for the potential differences in isolation properties of leptons in the \ttbar\ and \zjets\ topologies, an additional uncertainty of 0.5\% for muons and 1\% for electrons is assigned to the isolation component of scale factors.

The uncertainty on the jet energy resolution (JER) is determined by a variation of the JER in the simulated samples by $\pm 1\sigma$ in different $\eta$ regions according to the prescription given by the Jet/MET group.
